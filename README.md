Idea is to build a production ready microservices based data pipeline using Industry standard best practises and CNCF projects.

Using this project to get an idea of a fully fledged microservices project, will also implement this in Golang in the future cause why not?

Based on the brilliant [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/event-driven-microservices-spring-boot-kafka-and-elasticsearch/) by Ali Gelenler, do check it out!
